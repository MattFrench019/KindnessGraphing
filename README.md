# KindnessGraphing
Graphing the spread of Kindness using MatPlotLib and Numpy<br>
Done on request from **Sidcot School** as part of the [2020-06-19 Newsletter]()<br>
Commented Code can all be found in the [main.py](https://github.com/MattFrench019/KindnessGraphing/blob/master/Plotter.py) file<br>
<br>
To play with the code, download it using either the [Download Zip](https://github.com/MattFrench019/KindnessGraphing/archive/master.zip) button or click on the link.<br> Unzip the file and run:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should download and install all the dependencies for the project. As long as you have a version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you should be able to run the code.<br>
If everything has worked corrrectly, a graph should pop up and will also be save to [Graph.png](https://github.com/MattFrench019/KindnessGraphing/blob/master/Graph.png)
